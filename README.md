# Hybrid-Technique-for-Stock-Market-Forecasting
In Data science, stock pricing is a very significant and prosperous field especially as new methodologies and perspectives on the subject are continually gaining popularity.   In the present period, the daily use of social media and news headlines reached unprecedented levels, leading to the belief in the possibility of expressing public sentiment being linked to stock values. The aim is to recognise and anticipate future behaviour in different equity prices using patterns that support that correlation. Although individually uninteresting, the tweets and the news might certainly reflect public sentiment in an overall way. This Document analyses a project to collect and process past news from a thorough study, such as a Sentiment intensity analyser and textblob, to provide a positive, negative, neutral, subjectivity and polarity in the tweet and news corpus. The machine learning technique will then be used to assess the correlation of tweets to price behaviour. Finally, check the error forecast by comparing the results of the algorithm to the actual close price of the next day. The final objective of this project is, in general, to predict how the market will behave in the future through a sentimental analysis on several tweets and news in recent days and to assess whether the contrary sentiment theory applies. The final results are promising, because it observed a correlation between news, tweets and stock pricing.
